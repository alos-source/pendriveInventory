# Drive Inventory
##  Description
This script reads our basic parameters (like serial number or drive size) of a connected usb-drive and writes it to a json file in the user space. On the drive itself, a LostAndFound.txt-File will be stored.
## Motivation
I have loads of USB pendrives and hdd I use for backups and file transfers. Therefore, i am struggeling to keep an overview over those devices, and what's stored on them. This script should help me create an inventory of my storage devices.
Additionally, I asked myself what happens when one of my pendrives would get lost. So LostAndFound.txt-File should help the finder to return it to me.
